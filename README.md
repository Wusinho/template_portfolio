# GITHUB PROFILE TEMPLATE
##Summary
The project aims to revolutionize the process of updating and managing portfolios by introducing seamless automation. By leveraging GraphQL requests, the project enables automatic updates of the portfolio based on changes in the user's GitHub profile and pinned repositories.

## Objectives

- Streamline the process of updating your portfolio
- Implement automatic updates based on the time of visit
- Establish a standardized README template
- Easily pin your preferred repositories and the scrapper will do the work for you


## Description of the Project

For the development of the project, the following tools were used:

- Rails v 7.0.5
- Ruby 3.2.0
- Postgresql
- Github API
- Helloacm API

The purpose of this project is to reduce the time required to update your portfolio with new repositories and details. 
This can be easily achieved by writing a well-structured README and having the app to read it, and also pin your most outstanding repos.
